# Epilepsy Disorder Classification
Epilepsy disorder is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Seizures are sudden, brief episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, convulsions, muscle spasms, or altered awareness. Epilepsy can affect people of all ages and backgrounds and can be caused by various factors, including brain injury, genetics, or an underlying medical condition.

Seizures in epilepsy can vary widely, from staring spells and subtle movements to severe convulsions. The frequency and intensity of seizures can also vary from person to person. Diagnosis typically involves a detailed medical history, physical examination, and various neurological tests, including EEG (electroencephalogram) to measure brain activity.

Epilepsy is a chronic condition that can often be managed with medications, lifestyle modifications, or, in some cases, surgery. Treatment aims to control seizures, minimize side effects, and improve the quality of life for individuals living with epilepsy.

Developed a cutting-edge epilepsy disorder classification system leveraging EEG signals, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy in identifying various seizure types. Integrated advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, ensuring precise and efficient classification methodologies.

# How to Run the Epileptic Seizure Recognition System:

1. **Download the Files**: Obtain the necessary files from the repository. The repository includes:
   - `Code.m`: Matlab file containing the code for the seizure recognition system.
   - `Epileptic_Seizure_Recognition.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.
   - `README.md`: Contains detailed instructions and information.

2. **Configure Dataset Location**: If the Matlab file and the dataset are in the same folder, no changes are necessary. Otherwise, modify the input dataset file location in the code to match your system.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the `Code.m` file. The system will process the data and generate the outputs.

Note: The original dataset contains 5 classes, but it was modified for this project to address a two-class classification problem. The system performs classification specifically for these two classes.
